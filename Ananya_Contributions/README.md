## Ananya Sathyaranayana Contributions

## Approach 1: Object Detection

- Model training on RCNN using torchvsion Faster RCNN models , using COCO JSON dataset
- Developed Flask API using the best trained RCNN model for inference

**Artefacts shared:**

- Jupyter notebooks used in training and inference
- Best model weights for Detection using FasterRCNN - check in drive

- Flask API code using the best Faster RCNN model




## Approach 2: Instance Segmentation

- Model training on RCNN using torchvsion Mask and Faster RCNN models , using COCO JSON dataset
- Developed Flask API using the best trained YOLO model for inference

**Artefacts shared:**
- Jupyter notebooks used in training and inference
- Best model weights for segmentation using Mask RCNN - check in drive

- Flask API code using the best YOLO model

	(Note: YOLO model provided better performance and hence Flask API was built using YOLO model shared by Ramya)
